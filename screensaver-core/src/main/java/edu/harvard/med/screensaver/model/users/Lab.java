/**
 * A research lab, that has a {@link LabHead lab head} and {@link Lab#getLabMembers() lab members}. <br>
 * Note that a Lab is not directly represented in the physical database schema. Rather, a lab is persisted as a
 * LabHead. At the domain model level, it is conceptually
 * clearer to model a Lab as its own class, as this allows the lab head and its lab
 * members to all share and reference the same Lab object. In particular, this
 * allows the lab head to be determined for either a lab member or a lab head in
 * the same way: <code>labMember.getLab().getLabHead() == labHead.getLab().getLabHead()</code>
