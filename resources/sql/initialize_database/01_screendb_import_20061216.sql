Starting from an overnight culture of serovar Typhimurium grown in minimal media with 2 mM MgCl2:  Wash the bacteria x 2 in M9 minimal media without magnesium, then resuspend (10x concentrated) in M9 with no magnesium.  Then inoculate cultures of M9 with 10 mM or 10 microM MgCl2 with the overnight grown bacteria to an OD of approximately (10x dilution from overnight).  Grow for 10 hours at 37.  Compare bacterial density.  So simple!!  And it seems very reproducible in
5 ml cultures.
 
It is clear from experiments looking at a PhoP mutant, that PhoP is required for optimal growth in low [microM] Mg, but not in the [mM] range.  Thus compounds that selectively inhibit growth in low Mg but not in high Mg are potential PhoP inhibits that would then go on to the second round of screening, in which we would look at the expression of other PhoP related genes in a PhoP constitutive strain under high Mg conditions which thus would distinguish true PhoP inhibition from compounds that selectively inhibit MgtA which is the gene controlled by PhoP that is required for low Mg survival.

Traffic between the TGN and endosomes involves the evolutionarily conserved heterotrimeric  AP-1 and monomeric GGA clathrin adaptors.  Both types of adaptors bind to clathrin and transported transmembrane cargo, thus both are capable of fulfilling the essential role of recruiting clathrin to sites of vesicle formation. It is currently unclear whether AP-1 and GGAs mediated two independent pathways or cooperate in the same pathway or some combination of the two.  This screen takes advantage of the known synthetic lethality in yeast between AP-1 mutants and mutations in the GGA proteins.  Either GGA or AP-1 are sufficient for normal clathrin dependant trafficking and viability but cells containing mutations in both GGA and AP-1 are either severely compromised for clathrin trafficking or dead depending on the nature of the mutations.  The rational for this screen is that a chemical that inhibits AP-1 dependant trafficking would be lethal to cells with mutations in GGA genes but not wild-type cells.   Screening positives are compounds that are lethal or deleterious to cells carrying deletions in GGA genes but not to wild-type cells.

doesn''t seem to be causing a defect in traficking.  I have a couple of
assays left to do, some of them will be a bit tricky because I''ll have to
take into account the growth effect.  I''m not so worried that this chemical

OGT is a nodal point in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which is involved in complications of diabetes. The assay is based on the same concept as the Z"-LYTE assay sold by Invitrogen.  A peptide substrate for OGT is labeled with a FRET pair (in this case EDANS and Dabcyl) is reacted with the 500uM donor substrate (UDP-GlcNAc) and 100nM OGT.  After ~4h the glycosylation reaction is complete.  Trypsin (1ug/20uL rxn) is added and allowed to react for 1h.  The plate is then read for total fluorescence intensity at 535 nm.  Glycosylation occurs immediately N-terminal to the single trypsin site of the petide and confers resistance to proteolysis.  Under the conditions described above, a fourfold difference in fluorescence intensity is observed.  ', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 508, 65, 616);

The oligonucleotides form a Y-shaped annealed pair, consisting of 30 annealed residues and an additional 30 noncomplementary unannealed residues.  When annealed, the fluorescent label (6-FAM) and quencher (BHQ1) are held in close proximity, resulting in a low background level of fluorescence.  In the presence of a functional helicase and ATP, the duplex is unwound. One strand is then captured by a complementary unlabeled strand, present in molar excess, which prevents reannealing of the fluorescent and quencher strands.  This results in a measurable increase in fluorescence over time; this increase continues in a nearly linear manner for at least 40 minutes at room temperature and is completely ATP-dependent.

 There are several companies which sell the dye. But, Dojindo works out the cheapest if you are planning to use huge amounts of it. I used WST-1 which gave me the best values in the plate reader. I am also sending you an email correspondence that I had with Coy at Dojindo.

Dear Smitha:

Thank you for your inquiry.

Following is the information on the preparation of WST-1 and 1-Methoxy PMS working solution for proliferation and cytotoxicity assays.

Preparation of the working solution for 500 tests (96-well plate x 5
plates):
1. Dissolve 16.3 mg WST-1 in 4.5 mL of 20mM HEPES buffer (pH7.4). 2. Dissolve 7 mg 1-Methoxy PMS in 10 mL ddH2O or HEPES buffer. 3. Add 0.5 mL of the 1-Methoxy PMS solution from step 2 to the WST-1 solution from step 1. 4. If necessary, filter sterilize the working solution from step 3, using 0.22 um membrane filter.

The working solution is stable for 3 days at 0-5 C and for 1 month at -20 C.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.
Thank you.

Sincerely,
Coy

This screen intends to use an ELISA assay that has alrady been piloted in 96-well format.', '10/20/06 update:
Dear Caroline,

I wanted to update you on the work that Im doing with one of the compounds that I found during the screening at the ICCB.

The compound specifically inhibited the interaction of paxillin or leupaxin with ?4 integrin. It had no major effect on the interaction of Hic-5 with ?4 or FAT. Interestingly, a compound which is similar to the active compound and only has one methoxy group shifted from position 5 to position 2 was completely inactive.

The compound reduced Jurkat T cell migration performed in a Transwell migration assay in a dose dependent manner and to the same extend as it is reduced in Jurkat T cells that express ?4 with a mutation (Y991A) that disrupts the paxillin-?4 interaction.

In cell spreading assays on CHO as well as Jurkat T cells incubation with the compound led to increased cell spreading comparable with the used controls. As controls CHO-SD cells expressing the S998D mutation in the ?4 integrin or Jurkat JB4YA cells expressing the Y991A mutation in the ?4 integrin, both of which leading to disruption of paxillin binding show enhanced cell spreading, were used.

I further wanted to let you know, that we are about to apply for a patent on this compound. Im about to put my results together in a manuscript for publication. So please keep this information confidential.

 

Thanks a lot

In a parallel set of plates, the strain is plated out with a cocktail of 5 other antibiotics (carbenicillin, gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, rifampin, and chloramphenicol), to a final volume of 40 microliters.  We have worked out conditions so that the cocktail as a whole, has no effect on growth, taking into account any synergistic effects of the antibiotics. The concentration of each individual antibiotic is only 3-10 fold below the MIC for that given antibiotic.  In other words, the screen is designed so that any small molecule modulator that increases the sensitivity of the strain to any of the 5 given antibiotics by 3-10 fold, should be identified in the screen.

Hi Dara,

Last week Caroline told me to give you the list of my hits in the primary screening. Here is the summary:

1) Screening method: compounds that interfere with fluorescence polarization of BODIPY-GTP by GST-Nedd5 (a mouse septin GTPase), in search of inhibitors for GTP-binding
2) Library: "Russian" library,  plates #1-24
3) positive wells: 4A2*, 4*, 6*, 8*, 10*, 12*, 14*; 4I15, 5G10*, 5K20, 6G16, 7C2, 7C8, 8E10, 8I16, 9E4*,12,14;10E5,11B2, 11C4, 12F5, 12G5, 12L20,14B17, 14G20  (note: * contain similar core structure)
4) Secondary screen results: none of the compounds gave apparent strong effects on cultured human cells at 100uM.
5) Conclusion: Because of the negative results, we suspended further screening. Retrospectively, this fusion protein later turned out to be physiologically irrelevant, hence septin "complex" should have been used.
