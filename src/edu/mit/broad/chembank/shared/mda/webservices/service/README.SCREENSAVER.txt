README.SCREENSAVER.txt by john sullivan 2008.03

The files in this directory were autogenerated by Ant build rule chembank-wsimport in the project build.xml.

Normally I wouldn't check in generated files. But these are used by
edu.harvard.med.screensaver.io.libraries.compound.upgraders.ChembankIdUpgrader, and this class will not compile unless
they are present. Instead of forcing every developer to run this rule before the project can compile, I'm just
checking these files in.
