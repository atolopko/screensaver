### Build-time properties
# Used by Ant targets that build and deploy Screensaver.
# Changes to build-time properties require re-deploying the application to Tomcat (e.g., via 'ant restart')

# Authentication can be 'FORM' (Screensaver login web page) or 'BASIC' (browser dialog).  
# BASIC mode is useful during development, to avoid repeating the login step between Tomcat restarts.

# TODO: set your Tomcat installation directory here.

# Specify the Log4j properties file that will be used to control the logging output
# You may also want to edit the =log4j.properties.web= file itself to meet your logging output needs.
# Hint: during development, you can specify cfg/log4j.properties.debug, allowing you to maintain 
# debug-related logging options separately from your production/deployment log output settings.

# controls whether deployment is debug-enabled, which includes having debug-information 
# in compiled into deployed class files and enabling assertions (see build.xml)

# The version number of Screensaver

# The user interface for data table column selections; if false, a list-based column selector is shown,

## cellHTS2 properties

# The base directory containing the generated cellHTS2 reports.
# This should be a directory external to the Tomcat web application deployment directory and must already exist.

# and the Rserve "user" has sufficient file system permissions to write to this directory.

# Option to have cellHTS2Db save intermediate and final result R data objects to the file system.

## Database connection settings

# TODO: set the below variables to specify the connection settings for your PostgreSQL Screensaver database.
# Alternately, you can specify these four database connection settings as environment variables, which will override 
# the settings found below.  If using a password with your database user accounts (and you should!), we recommend 
# making use of PostreSQL's .pgpass file mechanism [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/libpq-pgpass.html], which 
# allows you to securely specify passwords.  To do so, comment out the =SCREENSAVER_PGSQL_PASSWORD= line below (prepend 
# with a =#= symbol). Screensaver will then read the password from the =.pgpass= file of the UNIX user under which 
# Tomcat is being run.
