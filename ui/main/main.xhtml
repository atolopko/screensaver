		The Screensaver development team recommends the <a
			href="www.mozilla.com">Mozilla Firefox Browser</a> (version 1.5 or
		higher). While we work to support other browsers, it's not always
		possible for us to test every feature across all browser types. <script
			type="text/javascript">
            if (! Array.every) { // if not firefox >=1.5
              document.getElementById("ie_detection_message").style.display = "block";
            }
          </script></div>

		<p>To get started, try clicking some of the items in the left menu
		bar. For a detailed description of what you can do, see our <a
			href="helpViewer.jsf">help</a> page. Here are a few highlights:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Use "Browse Libraries" to view the contents of ICCB-L
			compound and RNAi libraries, including structures, SMILES strings,
			vendor information, and when possible, links to PubChem (or GenBank
			for RNAi libraries).</li>
			<t:htmlTag value="li" rendered="#{menu.screener || menu.readAdmin}">
				Use "Find Wells" to search for information on a particular
				set of wells, such as those that scored as positive (or potentially
				positive) in your screen.
				<ul>
					<li><span class="new">New!</span>&#160;&#160;Updated PubChem
					CIDs have been assigned to Screensaver's compounds, allowing the
					user to directly navigate to the latest PubChem entries for each
					compound. PubChem provides information on the biological activities
					of small molecules.</li>
				</ul>
			</t:htmlTag>
			<li>Use "Browse Studies" to view the studies that have been
			added to Screensaver. Studies associate biologically significant
			annotations with library reagents.</li>
			<t:htmlTag value="li" rendered="#{menu.screener || menu.readAdmin}">
				"My Screens" permits access to your personal screen result
				data, if it has been loaded into the database. We are endeavoring to
				load all available screen result data, so if you find that your
				screen's result data is not available for viewing, please contact <a
					href="mailto:david_wrobel@hms.harvard.edu">David Wrobel</a> and we
				will make it a priority. Among the more useful features are the
				ability to view each screening data plate with a heat map viewer and
				to download the screen result data as a spreadsheet. Note that you
				will not be able to view screen results from any screens other than
				your own unless they have been classified as "shared" by the
				screener, in which case they are available for viewing. ICCB-L is in
				the process of developing guidelines for data sharing. Please
				contact <a href="mailto:caroline_shamu@hms.harvard.edu">Caroline
				Shamu</a> or <a href="mailto:su_chiang@hms.harvard.edu">Su Chiang</a> if
				you have any questions.</t:htmlTag>
			<li>From "Data Downloads" you can download SD files for all
			ICCB-L libraries, either as a single file or as individual library
			files (note that natural product extracts do not have SD files or
			structural information).</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The development team will be continuing to add features and
		enhancements, so your questions and feedback are welcome! Please use
		the feedback link at bottom of the page to contact the development
		team.</p>
