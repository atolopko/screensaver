      <dd>
			<p>Cherry Pick Request Viewer now supports Small Molecule Cherry
			Pick Requests. Additionally, the Lab Cherry Pick and Screener Cherry
			Pick data tables now provide search and column-selection features.</p>
			<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools'_Day">WAP 2.0</a>
			support added to web user interface for mobile browser access to
			Screensaver.</p>
			</dd>

      <dt><span class="newsDate">2008.Mar.31, v1.5.2</span></dt>
      <dd>
			<p>All search results pages now support a data export command that
			allows the contents of the data table to be downloaded as an Excel
			workbook. For Well Search Results, the SDF download option remains,
			but now respects any user-specified filtering criteria.</p>
			<p>ChemBank IDs have been added to Compounds. Well Viewer and
			Compound Viewer now contain this ID, and act as a link to the
			ChemBank application.</p>
			<p>New column selections have been added to the Well Search Results
			page: ICCB Number, Compound Names, ChemBank IDs, PubChem CIDs, CAS
			Numbers, NSC Numbers, and Genbank Accession Numbers.</p>
      <p>28 compound structures have been fixed in the ICCBBio1 library,
			allowing their compound structures to be viewed.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><span class="newsDate">2008.Feb.07, v1.5.1</span></dt>
      <dd>
      <p>Developers: Facelets view technology has replaced the use of
			JSP and Tiles.</p>
      <p>Screensaver now sports rounded corners on assorted panel areas.</p>
      </dd>

			<dt><span class="newsDate">2008.Feb.11, v1.5.0</span></dt>
			<dd>
			<p>The implementation of Search Result data tables has been
			entirely re-designed, providing the following benefits:
			<ul>
				<li>Improved performance and scalability for large data sets.
				In particular, sorting and filtering of large data sets is performed
				by the database, not by Screensaver. Near minimal sets of database
				operations are performed in response to user actions (open, scroll,
				sort, add/remove columns, etc.).</li>
				<li>Supports search results composed of columns across related
				entity types (e.g., Library, Well, Gene, Silencing Reagent), with
				user-configurable column selections, via a hierarchical column
				selection interface.</li>
				<li>For developers, simplified definition of Search Result
				pages, with nearly-declarative implementation (simply provide a name
				and an entity property binding for each column). Dynamically
				configurable data access strategy ("load all" or "virtual
				scrolling/paging"). No data access code required (i.e., no Hibernate
				queries).</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Users should note:
			<ul>
				<li>Screen Viewer's "Data" panel now has a full search
				interface, replacing the old "Show All, Show Plate, Show Positives"
				interface.</li>
				<li>Screen Viewer's "Data" panel now supports combining data
				columns from multiple screen results (data headers) and studies
				(annotations).</li>
				<li>Well Search Results pages should load faster for large data
				sets. For example, when viewing all wells for a library (accessed
				from the Library Viewer page).</li>
				<li>Creative use of the Search and Column selection features
				provide a basic level of custom reporting throughout Screensaver.</li>
			</ul>

			<dt><span class="newsDate">2007.Dec.07, v1.4.2</span></dt>
			<dd>
			<p>Cherry Pick Requests now allow an arbitrary set of
			screener-requested empty wells to be specified (rather than entire
			columns and rows).</p>

			</dd>

			<dt><span class="newsDate">2007.Dec.06, v1.4.1</span></dt>
			<dd>
			<p>Added Cherry Pick Requests Browser for administrators,
			allowing them to view that status of all cherry pick requests. Added
			additional status fields to the Cherry Pick Request Viewer to
			indicate whether the request has been completed.</p>
			</dd>

			<dt><span class="newsDate">2007.Dec.03, v1.4.0</span></dt>
			<dd>
			<p>Updated PubChem CIDs have been assigned to Screensaver's
			compounds, allowing the user to directly navigate to the latest
			PubChem entries for each compound. PubChem provides information on
			the biological activities of small molecules.</p>
			<p>Search results can be filtered by specifying criterion for
			each column in the search result data table.</p>
			<p>Screeners can now browse (and filter) all of their screening
			room activities in a search result page. Administrators can now
			browse (and filter) screening room users and staff in a search result
			page.</p>
			</dd>

			<dt><span class="newsDate">2007.Oct.12, v1.3.1</span></dt>
			<dd>
			<p>Administrator can now specify the set of rows to be left empty
			when Screensaver generates cherry pick plate mappings.</p>
			</dd>

			<dt><span class="newsDate">2007.Oct.11, v1.3.0</span></dt>
			<dd>
			<p>Upgraded the Screensaver object model to use Hibernate
			annotations instead of XDoclet annotations. Other various
			across-the-board model updates that should improve understanding,
			ease-of-use, and ease-of-maintenance of object model code for
			developers. This upgrade should have little to no impact on
			Screensaver users.</p>
			<p>Users will be pleased that all data tables in Screensaver now
			present a consistent and improved navigation panel for interacting
			with the table. Developers will be pleased that all data tables are
			now implemented in terms of the same DataTable class.</p>
			</dd>

			<dt><span class="newsDate">2007.Sep.13, v1.2.0</span></dt>
			<dd>
			<p>Added "Study" and "Annotations" data types to Screensaver,
			allowing the system to incorporate and present 3rd-party library
			annotation data, as well as providing a means for sharing and
			presenting biologically relevant results from in-house screens.</p>
			</dd>

			<dt><span class="newsDate">2007.Aug.24, v1.1.0</span></dt>
			<dd>
			<p>Screensaver released as open source project.</p>
			</dd>

			<dt><span class="newsDate">2007.Aug.6</span></dt>
			<dd>
			<p>Added workaround instructions for structure image viewing
			problems to the Well Viewer and Compound Viewer pages and help pages.</p>
