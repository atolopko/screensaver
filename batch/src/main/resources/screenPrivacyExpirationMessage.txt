IMPORTANT: ICCB-L/NSRB screen data due to be shared at Level 1
Dear ICCB-L/NSRB screener:

According to our records, the data associated with your screen, #{0},
entitled "{1}",
with the current data sharing level: {2},
will convert to Level 1 sharing on {3},
in accordance with the ICCB-L/NSRB user agreement that you
have signed.  Please note that Level 1 sharing occurs only within the
context of the Screensaver database and is not the same as public
release.  If you wish to delay conversion to Level 1 sharing, you must
provide a written request and justification for consideration by the
Advisory Committee that is responsible for your screen (ICCB-L or NSRB).

For requests or questions relating to screens, please contact
Jen Smith (jennifer_smith@hms.harvard.edu).
