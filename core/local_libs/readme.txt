These libraries in this directory are required by the Screensaver project, but
are not available via any Maven remote repositories and so need to be
installed in the local repository in order for the Maven build to work. 

To install into your local Maven repository, run:

 ../src/main/scripts/dev/maven-install-local-libs.sh
