Building the Project
-------------------------

There are two profiles, "webapp" and "batch"

webapp - (default) this builds the war
batch - this builds the screensaver-utils package for running the command line utilities

Required Property:

-Dscreensaver.properties.file is required

for web builds:
-Dbuild.number=`svnversion -n`

Useful Property:

-DskipTests=true

example:

mvn -Dscreensaver.properties.file=src/main/config/screensaver.properties.web package

or, to build the utils package:

mvn  -Dscreensaver.properties.file=src/main/config/screensaver.properties.utils -Dbuild.number=`svnversion -n` package -Pbatch
