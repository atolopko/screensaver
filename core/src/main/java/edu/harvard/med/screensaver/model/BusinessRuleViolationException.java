/**
 * Indicates that an attempt has been made to alter data in a way that violates
 * data requirements and/or real-world constraints. In general, the classes
 * implementing the data model are capable of preventing any <i>static</i>
 * state of the data from being invalid, but cannot capture whether transitions
 * between any two states is valid. When a state transition is invalid, the
 * system should throw a BusinessRuleViolationException.
 * <p>
 * BusinessRuleViolationExceptions are not expected to be thrown while
 * interacting with the data model via the Screensaver web user interface. If a
 * {@link BusinessRuleViolationException} is thrown out user interface code, you
 * can assume it is flawed in that it is allowing a non-valid action to occur.
 * (e.g. perhaps a command that should have been disabled for the current state
 * of the data model, was erroneously enabled).
