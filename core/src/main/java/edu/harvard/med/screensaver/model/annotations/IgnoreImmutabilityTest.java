/**
 * Instruct the testing framework to ignore setter violations for Immutable classes.<br/>
 * This should be used with care and is for convenience only.<br/>  
 * Note that if a class is marked as {@link Immutable} then the testing framework will fail for public setter methods; however
 * Hibernate will still require private setter methods.  Additionally, for creation, all values will have to be set either in the constructor, in "non-conventional" (i.e. not following the bean pattern) 
 * setter methods, or by exposing the class members as public.  If this is overly inconvenient, then this class may be used to override the testing framework behavior.
