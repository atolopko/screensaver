To allow developers to maintain individual Eclipse preference settings, each
developer maintains a developer-suffixed org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs file under
version control.  It is the responsibility of the developer to symlink their
respective file to org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs, for use by Eclipse.
