Screensaver README.txt
======================

This document contains general information about the Screensaver project,
which is contained herein.


Directory Contents
------------------

.eclipse.classes/  The place for Eclipse to build its own versions of the .class
                   files.
                  
.eclipse.prefs/    Contains developer-exported preference files from the Eclipse IDE, 
                   which are intended to be shared among the project's developers.

.settings/         The Eclipse .settings directory.

bin/               Executable scripts for development, deployment, etc.

build/             Destination for output generated by build.xml  Including
                   WAR (with exploded directory), Javadoc API, generated DDL
                   files, etc.  See build.xml for targets that use this directory.

cfg/               Configuration files for build- and run-time settings.
                   Subdirectories are organized by developers and hosts.

flotsam+jetsam/    Files that have been kept around for posterity, but are no longer
                   directly used by the project.  
                  
ui/                User interface definition files.  Defines web application user interface.  
                   Currently using Facelets view technology.                  

lib/               Java JAR (library) files.  Subdirectories reflect origins of
                   related JAR files.  JAR files at the top level of this directory 
                   are shared, and potentially satisfy dependencies of the project's
                   source code and of the third-party libraries used by the project 
                   (e.g. of Hibernate, XDoclet, etc.).  Subdirectories named
                   'unused' contain JARs that are not depended upon by the 
                   project's source code or third-party libraries.

licenses/          Software licenses for redistributed software.

resources/         Java resource files; i.e., files that can found within the 
                   project's Java classpath via Java's resource loading
                   mechanism.  Many files in this directory tree are generated
                   (Hibernate mapping files, build-number.txt, schema
                   create/drop scripts).

src/               Java source code (only! see resources/).

test/              Testing-related Java source code, including JUnit test
                   classes and test data files.

web/               Web application-specific files, used to generate a WAR file.

.classpath         The Eclipse .classpath file.

.project           The Eclipse .project file.

build.xml          Ant build file.

INSTALL.txt        Link to installation instructions for the Screensaver web application.

LICENSE.txt        GNU General Public License, under which the Screensaver
                   application is distributed.

NOTICE.txt         Legal mumbo jumbo.
