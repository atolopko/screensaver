JavaBean tests:

- test bidirectionaliy of relationships

Hibernate bean tests:

- test n-arg constructor arg list matches not-null properties
- test not-null properties start out initialized
- test not-not-null properties start out uninitialized
- test set; persist; get
- test { set; persist; get; } for relationships
- test bidirectionality of relationships over persist
- test setting a not-null property to null throws exception
- test relationship methods have correct names and sigs
- test getId() is public and setId() is private
- test isVersioned
- test set-properties have add/remove methods, public setter & private getter
  - (how does this relate to set-relationships?)
