xdoclet-1.2.3 delivered with the following version of xjavadoc.jar:

  xjavadoc-1.1.jar

however, xjavadoc-1.5, not yet in production release, is needed to correctly
parse Java 5 generics. for this reason, we have included the following
version of the xjavadoc.jar here:

  xjavadoc-1.5-snapshot050611.jar

and moved the xjavadoc-1.1.jar to the unused subdirectory.
