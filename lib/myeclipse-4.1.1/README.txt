Contains JARs that were provided/suggested by the MyEclipseIDE development 
environment, when the project was defined as a "web application".  We're 
not actually using any of these suggested JARs, but we are saving them here,
under the "unused" subdirectory, for posterity, safekeeping, and general 
anal retentiveness.
